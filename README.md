# Ping Pong Translate Application
App to translate back-and-forth between two languages hosted on GCP. WUT MINI Cloud Computing Project.

## Overview
This app allows uploading phrases from different languages. 
The phrase is then translated by a machine learning model into another language, and then the process is repeated multiple times (in a “ping pong” manner) translating the phrase from source language to target language and back.
In the end the user can view how the phrase was distorted by multiple translations.
